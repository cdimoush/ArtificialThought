Streaming is HARD!

Here is what i need to do further break down ui_components. Such that there are separate methods for message info and message content.

One you do that, consider having the message be rewritten post stream to fix any potential problems with the formatting.

Then move to upgrading the stream. The stream will need be created containers for the message info and message content. I expect to have problems extracting info from the tools so I might need to create placeholders, queue, or non-callback based logging for those.
