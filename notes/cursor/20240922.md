# 2024-09-22_0
The project's name is `ArtificalThought` or `athought` for short. It is a streamlit application that allows for "easy" development of large language model demos wrapped in a chat bot interface.

I say "easy" and not easy because the layout of the project is still somewhat complicated. I need assistance simplifying it.

# AI Task
Improve the `app.py` and code in the `src/app` directory.

## Files
- app.py
- src
    - app
        - initialization.py
        - ui_components.py
        - chat_interface.py

    - agents
        - agent-handler.py
        - agents.py
        - base_agent.py
        - prompt.py

## Specifics
Remove anything to do with drafting. This is `draft_area` and `draft_cache`.

## To Do List
Here's a revised list of all references to drafting and related functionality that need to be removed:

1. In `app.py`:
   - Remove `APP_MODE.DRAFT` from the `APP_MODE` enum.
   - Remove the creation of `col2`:
     ```python
     if st.session_state.app_mode == APP_MODE.DRAFT:
         col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
         with col1:
             st.session_state['col1'] = st.container()
         with col2:
             st.session_state['col2'] = st.container()
     ```
   - Remove any other references to `col2` or `APP_MODE.DRAFT`.

2. In `src/app/initialization.py`:
   - Remove line: `st.session_state['draft_cache'] = ''`
   - Remove any initialization of `APP_MODE.DRAFT` if present.

3. In `src/app/chat_interface.py`:
   - Remove function `add_references_to_query()`
   - Remove line: `query = add_references_to_query(st.session_state.draft_cache)`
   - Remove line: `st.session_state.draft_cache = ''`
   - Remove function: `def handle_draft_area():`
   - Remove the entire `if st.session_state.app_mode == APP_MODE.DRAFT:` block and its contents.
   - Remove any other references to `draft_cache`, `draft_area`, or `APP_MODE.DRAFT`.

4. In `src/app/ui_component.py`:
   - No changes needed based on the current information.

5. In `config.py` (if it exists):
   - Remove `DRAFT` from the `APP_MODE` enum if present.

To remove drafting functionality, we need to:
1. Remove all `draft_cache` and `draft_area` references and related functionality.
2. Remove the `APP_MODE.DRAFT` state and any logic that depends on it.
3. Remove the creation and usage of `col2`.
4. Update the main application flow to work without the drafting feature.
5. Ensure that the chat interface still functions correctly after these changes.

After making these changes, we should:
1. Test the application thoroughly to ensure it works correctly without the drafting feature.
2. Update any documentation or comments that mention drafting functionality.
3. Remove any unused imports that were related to drafting.
4. Consider simplifying the layout now that we don't need to accommodate the draft area.
