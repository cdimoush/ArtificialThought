The project's name is `ArtificalThought` or `athought` for short. It is a streamlit application that allows for "easy" development of large language model demos wrapped in a chat bot interface.

I say "easy" and not easy because the layout of the project is still somewhat complicated. I need assistance simplifying it.

# AI Task
Read the user provided files and understand the project layout.


## Files
- app.py
- src
    - app
        - initialization.py
        - ui_components.py
        - chat_interface.py

    - agents
        - agent-handler.py
        - agents.py
        - base_agent.py
        - prompt.py


## NOTE
After reviewing the provided files, here's an overview of the project layout and structure:

1. The main application entry point is `app.py`, which sets up the Streamlit page configuration, handles session initialization, and manages the main application loop.

2. The `src/app` directory contains core application components:
   - `initialization.py`: Handles session state initialization, including setting up the agent handler, file handler, and menu manager.
   - `ui_components.py`: Contains functions for displaying the application title, chat history, and system messages.
   - `chat_interface.py`: Manages the chat interface, including handling user queries, agent responses, and draft mode functionality.

3. The `src/agents` directory contains the agent-related components:
   - `agent_handler.py`: Manages the creation and switching of different agent types.
   - `agents.py`: Defines various agent classes (ChainableAgent, SimpleAgent, IntrospectiveAgent, RoleAgent) with different capabilities.
   - `base_agent.py`: Provides an abstract base class for all agents.
   - `prompt.py`: Contains predefined prompt templates for different agent roles and tasks.

4. The application uses a flexible agent system that allows for different types of agents with varying capabilities, from simple response generation to more complex, role-based interactions.

5. The project implements a chat interface with support for draft mode, file uploading, and integration with external services like Pinecone for conversation saving.

6. The application uses Streamlit for the user interface, allowing for easy creation of interactive web applications.

7. The project structure separates concerns well, with distinct modules for initialization, UI components, and chat interface management.

## GeneralSuggestions
To simplify the project layout, consider:

1. Consolidating similar agent types to reduce code duplication.
2. Creating a more standardized interface for agent interactions.
3. Simplifying the chat interface logic in `chat_interface.py`.
4. Documenting the purpose and interactions of each module more clearly.
