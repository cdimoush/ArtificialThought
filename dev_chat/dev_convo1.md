Yes, the bundling process should produce a JavaScript file that can be used by Streamlit. However, there are a few things to note:

1. **Output Directory**: The bundled JavaScript file should be placed in the `frontend/build` directory as specified in your Python code. This is where Streamlit will look for the component's frontend code.

2. **Main JavaScript File**: The main JavaScript file that is the entry point of your application should be named `index.js`. This is the default name that Streamlit looks for. If your bundling process produces a file with a different name, you might need to rename it to `index.js`.

3. **Static Files**: If your component uses any static files (like CSS or images), these should also be placed in the `frontend/build` directory. You might need to adjust your bundling configuration to ensure these files are included in the output.

4. **React and ReactDOM**: Streamlit's custom components are built using React. The bundled JavaScript file should include the component's code, but not the React or ReactDOM libraries themselves. Streamlit provides these libraries automatically. If your bundling process includes these libraries in the output, you might need to adjust your configuration to exclude them.

5. **Bundling Configuration**: Depending on your component's code and the bundler you're using, you might need to adjust your bundling configuration. For example, if your component uses JSX syntax, you'll need to ensure your bundler is configured to handle this.

If you follow these guidelines and place the resulting bundled file(s) in the correct location, Streamlit should be able to use your custom component. If you encounter any issues, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you resolve them.

 Are you sure this bundling of the typescript will product the output that streamlit expects if I drag files to the build directory?
 

### ai
Sure, I can guide you through the process. Here are the general steps you would follow to bundle your TypeScript code. This assumes you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you'll need to install those first.

1. **Install TypeScript and a bundler**: TypeScript is a npm package that you can install globally on your machine. You'll also need a bundler like webpack or parcel. For simplicity, let's use parcel in this example. You can install both with the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript parcel-bundler
   ```

2. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript**: Navigate to the directory containing your `.tsx` file and run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). This will compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript code that can be run in a browser. The `--jsx react` flag is used to specify that the input files are using JSX syntax (React).

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/typescript/directory
   tsc --jsx react
   ```

   This will create a new `.js` file in the same directory as your `.tsx` file.

3. **Bundle your code**: Now you can use parcel to bundle your code. This will create a single JavaScript file that includes your code and any dependencies it uses.

   ```bash
   parcel build yourfile.js
   ```

   Replace `yourfile.js` with the name of the JavaScript file created in the previous step. This will create a `dist` directory containing the bundled code.

4. **Update your Streamlit component**: Finally, you'll need to update your Streamlit component to use the new bundled code. The exact steps for this will depend on how your component is set up, but typically you would replace the existing bundled file with the new one you just created.

Remember to restart your Streamlit app after replacing the bundled file to see your changes take effect.

Please note that these are general steps and might need to be adjusted based on your specific setup. If you encounter any issues, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you resolve them.

ohh exuse me I have access to the .tsx file. I think I am following on bundling I have never done that before. Can you walk me through the steps. I have made changes to the .tsx file locally. Do I need any other files? Tell me what terminal commands to run? I assume I can do this all in a bash terminal.

### ai
Yes, you're correct. The `.tsx` file is a TypeScript file, which is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types and some other features to the language. TypeScript needs to be compiled to JavaScript before it can be run in a browser.

When you're using Streamlit with custom components, the component's frontend code is typically written in TypeScript or JavaScript and then bundled into a single JavaScript file using a tool like webpack or parcel. This bundled file is what's actually sent to the browser when you run your Streamlit app.

If you're not seeing the `.tsx` file in the GitHub repo, it's possible that the author of the repo has only included the bundled JavaScript file and not the original TypeScript source files. This is common in production settings where the source code might be minified or otherwise optimized for performance.

If you want to modify the frontend code of the component, you'll need to find the original TypeScript or JavaScript source files. If these files aren't included in the repo, you might need to reach out to the author of the repo for the original files.

Once you have the source files, you can make your changes, then re-bundle the frontend code and replace the existing bundled file in your Streamlit app. You'll need to have Node.js and npm installed to do this, and you might also need to install other dependencies depending on how the frontend code is set up.

Remember to restart your Streamlit app after replacing the bundled file to see your changes take effect.
### human
Ok I found this TypeScript code (AudioRecorder.tsx) on the github repo I am using. When I clone the repo I don't see the file. Is this the nature of .tsx and how front end code works with streamlit. Compiling. I'm confused I want to edit this file and see changes in the app.

### ai
Yes, you're correct. The `onClicked` function in the `AudioRecorder.tsx` file is where the recording starts and stops when the button is clicked. This is where you would add the debounce functionality.

In JavaScript (and TypeScript), debouncing is often used with event handlers to limit the rate at which a function can fire. A delay is set and if the event (in this case, a button click) is fired before the delay is over, the handler waits until the delay is over to invoke the function.

Here's how you can modify the `onClicked` function to add a debounce:

```tsx
private onClicked = debounce(async () => {
  if (!this.recording){
    await this.start()
  } else {
    await this.stop()
  }
}, 250);  // 250ms delay
```

In this example, the `debounce` function is not defined. You would need to import a debounce function from a library like lodash, or define your own. Here's an example of a simple debounce function:

```tsx
function debounce(func, wait) {
  let timeout;

  return function executedFunction(...args) {
    const later = () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      func(...args);
    };

    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
  };
};
```

This debounce function works by setting a timeout when the button is clicked. If the button is clicked again before the timeout is over, the timeout is cleared and a new one is set. The function passed to `debounce` (in this case, the anonymous function that starts or stops the recording) is only called when the timeout is over, effectively limiting how often the function can be called.

Please note that this is a simple debounce function and might not cover all edge cases. For a more robust solution, consider using a library like lodash.

 Is this where you would add the button debounce? If not where else should I look. This isn't my code. Please help me understand.
 

### ai
The issue you're experiencing might be due to the way Streamlit handles component state. When you first load the page, Streamlit runs your script from top to bottom. When you click the record button, it triggers a rerun of the script, which might be causing the button to reset.

One way to potentially solve this issue is to use Streamlit's session state to store the state of the recording button. You can check this state each time the script runs and use it to determine whether the button should be in the recording state or not.

However, since the issue seems to be with the frontend component, it might be more appropriate to handle this in the frontend code. If you have access to the frontend code, you might want to look into adding a debounce function to the button's click event. This would prevent the button from triggering multiple rapid clicks, which could be causing the issue.

A debounce function works by delaying the processing of the button click event until a certain amount of time has passed without the button being clicked again. This can help to prevent rapid, unintended toggling of the button state.

Here's a simple example of a debounce function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait) {
    let timeout;

    return function executedFunction(...args) {
        const later = () => {
            clearTimeout(timeout);
            func(...args);
        };

        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
    };
};
```

You can use this function to debounce your button click event like so:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', debounce(handleClick, 250));
```

In this example, the `handleClick` function will not be called until 250 milliseconds have passed without the button being clicked again. This should help to prevent the rapid toggling of the button state.

Please note that this is a frontend solution and would require modifications to the frontend code of your Streamlit component. If you don't have access to the frontend code, you might need to reach out to the author of the component for support.

 The problems is that the first time I click the record button, the button toggles goes on and off quick then sends an empyt bytes object. The second time I click the record button, it works right.
 
 Why could this be happening? Do you need more backend code? Is there I way I can debounce the button with only editting the code I have shown you?

Sure, here is your adapted code:

```python
# Native Python libraries
import os
from io import BytesIO
# Third-party libraries
import streamlit as st
from audio_module.audio_recorder_streamlit import audio_recorder
import assemblyai as aai

st.title('Streamlit Audio -> Summary')

# Get the API key from the environment variable
api_key = os.getenv('ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY')
# Set the API key in the AssemblyAI settings
aai.settings.api_key = api_key
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

def transcribe_audio(transcriber, audio_bytes):
    # Create a BytesIO object from the audio bytes
    audio_file = BytesIO(audio_bytes)
    try:
        # Upload the audio data
        response = transcriber._client.http_client.post(
            'https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload',
            content=audio_file,
        )
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an exception if the response contains an HTTP error status code
        audio_url = response.json()["upload_url"]
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Failed to upload audio data: {e}")
        return None

    try:
        # Transcribe the uploaded audio data
        transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url)
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Failed to transcribe audio data: {e}")
        return None

    return transcript

def main():
    # Create placeholders for your output
    transcript_placeholder = st.empty()

    # Check if we're in the initial state
    if 'first_time' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state['first_time'] = True

    # Capture audio
    if st.session_state['first_time'] or not st.session_state.get('audio_bytes'):
        audio_bytes = audio_recorder() # Returns audio in bytes (audio/wav)
        st.session_state['audio_bytes'] = audio_bytes

    # Transcribe audio
    if st.session_state['audio_bytes'] and not st.session_state.get('transcript'):
        transcript = transcribe_audio(transcriber, st.session_state['audio_bytes'])
        st.session_state['transcript'] = transcript

    # Display transcript
    if st.session_state.get('transcript'):
        transcript_placeholder.text(st.session_state['transcript'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code follows the structure you provided and includes the functionality from your original code. It captures audio and transcribes it, storing the results in the Streamlit session state and displaying them in a placeholder.

### ai
Sure, I'd be happy to explain!

The `st.session_state.get()` method is used to safely retrieve a value from the session state dictionary. It's similar to the standard Python dictionary's `get()` method. 

The reason we use `get()` instead of directly accessing the dictionary key (like `st.session_state['key']`) is because if the key does not exist in the dictionary, `get()` will return `None` by default, whereas direct access will raise a `KeyError` exception. 

In the context of your app, this means that if the 'transcript' or 'summary' keys have not been set in the session state yet (because the transcription or summarization process has not completed), the `get()` method will simply return `None` and the corresponding conditional block will not be executed. This helps to prevent errors and makes the code more robust.
### human
Great really quick explain why you are using st.session_state.get() in the conditionals. Think I understand. Just a few words.

### ai
Streamlit is a great tool for building interactive data applications. It's designed to be easy to use, but it does have some unique features that can be a bit confusing at first. Here are some suggestions on how to structure your app.py file to work well with Streamlit:

1. **Use Streamlit's Session State**: Streamlit doesn't have a built-in concept of a session state, but it does provide a workaround using the `st.session_state` attribute. This attribute is a dictionary that persists across reruns of your script, allowing you to store stateful information. In your case, you can use it to store the state of the transcription and summary processes.

2. **Use Streamlit's Caching**: Streamlit's `@st.cache` decorator allows you to cache the results of long-running functions, so that they can be reused across multiple runs of your script. This can be very useful for expensive operations like audio transcription and text summarization. However, be aware that the cache is based on the function's input arguments, so it may not work as expected if your function has side effects or depends on external state.

3. **Organize Your Code into Functions**: Streamlit scripts are run from top to bottom each time a user interacts with the app, so it's important to organize your code into functions that can be called conditionally. This will allow you to control the flow of your app and prevent unnecessary computation.

4. **Use Placeholders for Dynamic Output**: Streamlit's `st.empty()` function creates a placeholder that you can update later with dynamic content. This can be useful for displaying the results of your transcription and summarization processes.

5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Your current code already does a good job of this, but it's worth mentioning that you should always handle errors gracefully in a Streamlit app. This includes catching exceptions, displaying informative error messages to the user, and recovering from errors when possible.

Here's a rough outline of how you might structure your app.py file:

```python
import streamlit as st
# ... other imports ...

# Initialize your transcriber and summarizer
transcriber = initialize_transcriber()
summarizer = initialize_summarizer()

def main():
    # Create placeholders for your output
    transcript_placeholder = st.empty()
    summary_placeholder = st.empty()

    # Check if we're in the initial state
    if 'first_time' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state['first_time'] = True

    # Capture audio
    if st.session_state['first_time'] or not st.session_state.get('audio_bytes'):
        audio_bytes = capture_audio()
        st.session_state['audio_bytes'] = audio_bytes

    # Transcribe audio
    if st.session_state['audio_bytes'] and not st.session_state.get('transcript'):
        transcript = transcribe_audio(transcriber, st.session_state['audio_bytes'])
        st.session_state['transcript'] = transcript

    # Display transcript
    if st.session_state.get('transcript'):
        transcript_placeholder.text(st.session_state['transcript'])

    # Summarize transcript
    if st.session_state.get('transcript') and not st.session_state.get('summary'):
        summary = summarize_text(summarizer, st.session_state['transcript'])
        st.session_state['summary'] = summary

    # Display summary
    if st.session_state.get('summary'):
        summary_placeholder.text(st.session_state['summary'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is just a rough outline, and you'll need to fill in the details based on your specific requirements. But hopefully it gives you a good starting point!

The app is taking shape. Here is the app.py file I have now. It has audio capture and transcriber built. I want to add the LLM function now. (This will be imported from the ai_module.summary_chain and use the SummaryChain class). 
 
 
 *app.py*
 ```python
 # Native Python libraries
 # -----------------------
 import os
 from io import BytesIO

 # Third-party libraries
 # -----------------------
 # Streamlit

 from audio_module.audio_recorder_streamlit import audio_recorder
 # Audio
 import assemblyai as aai
 from pydub import AudioSegment
 
 st.title('Streamlit Audio -> Summary')
 
 # Get the API key from the environment variable
 api_key = os.getenv('ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY')
 # Set the API key in the AssemblyAI settings
 aai.settings.api_key = api_key
 transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
 
 audio_bytes = audio_recorder() # Returns audio in bytes (audio/wav)
 
 def transcribe_audio(transcriber, audio_bytes):
     # Create a BytesIO object from the audio bytes
     audio_file = BytesIO(audio_bytes)
     try:
         # Upload the audio data
         response = transcriber._client.http_client.post(
             'https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload',
             content=audio_file,
         )
         response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an exception if the response contains an HTTP error status code
         audio_url = response.json()["upload_url"]
     except Exception as e:
         st.error(f"Failed to upload audio data: {e}")
         return None
 
     try:
         # Transcribe the uploaded audio data
         transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url)
     except Exception as e:
         st.error(f"Failed to transcribe audio data: {e}")
         return None
 
     return transcript
 
 # Use the new function to transcribe the audio bytes
 transcript_placeholder = st.empty()
 if 'first_time' not in st.session_state:
     st.session_state['first_time'] = True
 
 if st.session_state['first_time']:
     transcript_placeholder.text(f'Please speak your transcription will appear here....')
 
 if audio_bytes:
     transcript_placeholder.text('Loading...')
     transcript = transcribe_audio(transcriber, audio_bytes)
     if transcript: 
         transcript_placeholder.text(transcript.text)
         st.session_state['first_time'] = False
     else:
         transcript_placeholder.text('Transcription failed... Try again....')
         print("Transcription failed")
 
 
 ```
 
 Before I add the SummaryChain class, I want organize the app.py structure to work better with streamlit. I do NOT know how streamlit works. It is new to me. It is really important to me that the summary function calls don't start until a successful transcription has been made and verified. All is important, that audio capture is not available or running will summary function calls are being made.
 
 Please recommend a structure for the app.py file that will work well with streamlit. I want to talk. Are st.session_state and st.cache the right tools for this? I am not sure. I am open to any suggestions.
