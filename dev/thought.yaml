summary_0: 'Summary: The speaker proposes a concept for an automated AI system that
  can transcribe audio to text, process that text, and further generate concise summaries.
  This idea is inspired by the challenge of articulating ideas and intentions effectively
  in off-the-cuff audio recordings. The proposed system will involve a chain of language
  models tasked with correcting errors, summarizing content, and extracting useful
  information from the ramblings. Despite being primarily an art project, the system
  could yield interesting and useful results if executed properly.'
summary_1: 'Summary: The speaker proposes a project for improving data processing
  in audio-to-text conversions. Rather than using raw data from basic converters like
  Google Speech API, the project should manage, clean, and label the data to create
  a high-quality dataset. The aim is to compress larger, messier data into concise,
  articulate thoughts, enhancing data analysis and usability in machine learning and
  artificial intelligence applications.'
summary_2: 'Summary: The project, aimed at storing and visually representing ideas,
  was inspired by another plan to consolidate articles and news. It incorporates artificial
  intelligence technology to act as a journalist, conduct research from existing content,
  and produce reports. This process involves data analysis, data visualization, and
  software development.'
summary_3: 'Summary: The speaker discusses a project involving downloading instructional
  YouTube videos, particularly in technical fields like science and math. The subtitles
  or closed captions from these videos are extracted and stored in a vector database.
  This database can then be queried by a chatbot, allowing it to access relevant information
  during a conversation. Essentially, the chatbot can draw on knowledge it has ''gained''
  from watching these videos to assist users discussing topics like math or science.'
summary_4: 'Summary: The project, named Genesis, is a learning platform that also
  functions as a chat room. It''s primarily a development space for sophisticated
  conversations with different individuals who specialize in specific subjects. The
  system utilizes large language models and AI agents, allowing for complex code deployment
  and the selection of system prompts before making API calls. A unique feature is
  a chat button with a rolling memory behind the scenes. The platform also includes
  a user role selection feature, which allows users to choose the agent personality
  they want to chat with, thus streamlining the process of passing queries onto the
  correct system prompt.'

  \ a AI brain that will process the text and turn it into more concise summarizations.\
  \ The idea really stems out of the inability to concisely accurately and effectively\
  \ describe plants and intention when recording audio off the cuff. For example,\
  \ this sort of ramble here is a attempted articulation at a more sophisticated idea.\
  \ it can potentially generally get a point across but will never contain all of\
  \ the necessary items to complete set project or task contradictory statements.\
  \ Any who the idea here is to have the LLMBA chain of multiple LM models with specific\
  \ prompts for handling with The large rambles that come in in firstly, raw audio\
  \ to text then it will be the LOM, responsibilities to first correct most basic\
  \ errors, then perform summaries, and then extract useful information. It will also\
  \ be the LLM or the AI discretion to extract certain concepts. This is going to\
  \ be a majority automated process, wish more of potentially an art project than\
  \ an affective tool however, if properly interesting useful results could come out.\
  \ \n"
thought_1: "So I have been thinking and now I am talking about a project where you\
  \ store audio to text conversions. However, I\u2019m not interested in the raw text\
  \ from a more basic converter like Google speech, API or pockets. Thanks what I\
  \ am interested in is for the project itself to be able to except clean and modify\
  \ the raw inputs. Almost like creating a higher quality cleaned up labeled data\
  \ set. The idea here is that the , larger looser dirtier data can be compressed\
  \ down, so larger, loose semantics press down into articulate backed thoughts that\
  \ can be presented to either the user or or or other people.\n"
thought_2: 'I think the project for storing ideas, and then displaying them in a consolidated
  improved format, first stemmed from another project idea, which was the consolidation
  of articles and news, and then have a sort of bot or AI. That is a journalist and
  can read and do research from previously publish material, and then use that material
  to produce a report .

  '
thought_3: "One idea that I\u2019ve been working with is the download of YouTube videos\
  \ I\u2019m more interested in videos that have content to them that service either\
  \ classes or instruction. I\u2019m especially interested in technical disciplines\
  \ like science and math. What I\u2019m doing with these download videos is extracting\
  \ the subtitles or close caption text And storing them inside a vector database.\
  \ Then a chat pot more common chat, like CBT for through the open AI website that\
  \ sort of chat can query the database. If it feels like there is information that\
  \ exist in it that is relevant to a conversation. So if, the user would like to\
  \ talk about math and sort of think about the chat but as have watching a bunch\
  \ of YouTube videos, was able to recall information on the spot and utilize it to\
  \ assist the user in and chat dialogue.\n"
thought_4: Another idea is just a learning platform maybe or I guess I had aspirations
  that could be more but I called the project. Genesis Genesis was a sort of room
  or development space for chat, but I thought about it more as a room that you enter
  into have a conversation with one other individual, but certain individuals in the
  room might be better or more Signed to talk about specific subjects, easiest and
  most direct approach was just having the ability to select new system prompts for
  large language models before making API calls and putting in the framework is a
  chat button so be able to have a rolling memory behind the scenes, the project into
  the ability to deploy more complex code large language models used as AI agents
  so the ability to call functions. Currently have an implemented to crazy of a function
  really the only one that I use now consistently is a switch where someone is, taking
  the users role of selecting that system, prompt or the type of agent personality
  they want to be chatting with and instead there is a general point that can use
  discretion in order to pass the query onto the correct system prompt.
